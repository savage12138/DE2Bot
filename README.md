# DE2Bot
The project demo area is the space in the lab adjacent to the whiteboard, TV, and desk. It will contain seven sonar reflectors in random positions within the green area shown in Figure 1, but with their centers spaced at least 3â€™ apart to allow for the DE2Bot to maneuver between them. The seven squares in Figure 1 represent sonar reflectors in an example distribution, with the red circles indicating the minimum spacing. The goal of the project is to have the DE2Bot find and circle as many of the reflectors as possible within two minutes.
